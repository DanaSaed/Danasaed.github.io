        <h3>About the canteen</h3>
        <p> nutritious diet is essential to healthy brain development in children, which is critical to good learning.
        Our school kitchen team prepares fresh meals every day on site. As well as a range of wholesome, nutritious and delicious snacks and meals for all, the team also provides for students with special dietary needs.
        There is a daily morning snack, afternoon snack, and at lunchtime a soup starter and two main courses, one of each being a vegetarian option. Parents are provided with a menu in advance of each week and are able to select the food they would like their children to be served each day.</p>
